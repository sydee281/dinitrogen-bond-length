# dinitrogen-bond-length
This repository contains the code used to generate a set of predictors and their coefficients to predict the bond length in a dinitrogen molecule.

This project was written in Python and utilizes data mining techniques as well as both single-variant(SLR) and multi-variant(MLR) linear regression to create the mathematical model.
It has been specifically trained on dinitrogen molecules bonded to 2 metal atoms which are in turn bonded to organic ligands.
The reference codes for these molecules are:
